            <i>Imagine 2 men. men A asking "What your taste?", man B says "I'm will tell you"</i>

        <div class="text">
            <p>For some reason, you asking my <i>weeb taste.</i> Here I'm will answer it.</p>
            <p>The first anime that I watch is a slice of life, comedy, romance, school genre. That is the main pillar of my taste. From that, I moved to harem, ecchi genre that I enjoy, for some time I'm starting to explore another genre.</p>
            <p>Here is the data:</p>
            <iframe src="https://anime.plus/s3_j0d1/favorites,anime" width="100%" height="500px">
            </iframe>
            <p>I'm really don't care about score/review. But sometimes score/review can make some good decisions if the anime is a <i>little bit controversial or really bad.</i> Well, sometimes I use score/review to make biased score/review and also watch anime from different perspectives.</p>
            <p>I don't really prefer anime that is full of fighting, gore, scary stuff, shonen, or <i>too manly</i>. Sometimes I prefer that to balance my taste.</p>
             <p><i>Hey, I tell you my secret. The lowest anime on my anime list is not that bad. Yes, it is still bad, but still have their own specialty. That just I get biased.</i></p>
            <p>If you are new to watching anime. The type of genre of anime you watching will shape your anime preference and taste. <s><i>So be careful to pick your anime.</i></s></p>
            <p>Well, my taste is still developing. Maybe in the future anime that I don't really understand or not my taste get watched because I'm getting more <i>cultured.</i></p>
