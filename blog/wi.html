      <p>Hello readers, it's been a long time I didn't post a blog. Lately, I'm more consuming isekai genre. maybe some people are curious why some people enjoy watching it (although maybe no people ask it).</p>
      <p>Isekai literally means "different world", a world that is a different world from our world. And accompanied with medieval age, magic, monster, and more that don't exist in our world. By that definition, it's basically a fantasy, what makes it different is in the core. Isekai is Fantasy + Adventure + Reincarnation. The MC sometimes live a difficult life in the "original world", they get reincarnated to a different world and accompanied by some heroine to explore the different world.</p>
      <p>Done with that rough explanation of isekai. let's jump into why I'm liking it. The reason why I'm liking it is I like to watch people live their life (not in a creepy mean). Because I can see how the MC tackle problem that faced them, the emotion, life lesson, regret, and more (basically their adventure) something that makes life valuable. Not all is beautiful I guess <i><b>Cough..Cough</b> Re: Zero</i>.</p>
      <p>Maybe not fit with this topic, for me, anime is just like food and genre is like flavour. There are people who like it, there are people who hate it. It depends on your taste and appetite. If the chef (author) makes the food with proper technic, proper ingredients, proper tools, and love, the dish will be loved by everyone.</p>
      <p>So the conclusion is isekai is quite an interesting genre, a perfect watch material when your life gets a little bit boring.</p>
