            <i>Let's remember about history, long ago humans studied in rooms called "classrooms" and buildings called "schools"</i>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p>It has been more than 1 year that COVID has hit Indonesia. People's movement was restricted, places that could become gatherings were closed, schools were closed, almost everything was closed. Inside the house with the same view, because it's been so long at home that even going out of the house just to buy necessities feels like refreshing the body and even thinking <i>"Wow... it turns out that going out of the house is healthy"</i>. The government is campaigning for "New Normal" and we even forget the definition of normal life as before.</p>
          <p>The pandemic in Indonesia has hit Indonesia's education system hard. The Indonesian government when this virus came to this country could not move due to a lack of strategy and preparation during a pandemic. Even so, the government is always trying to fix the problems caused by the lack of strategy and preparation, but some of its implementations are ineffective and displeasing to the people.</p>
          <p>The government's solution for conducting education in the midst of a pandemic is <i>sekolah daring</i> (<i>dalam jaringan</i>/online). While this solution doesn't work effectively, here's the problem.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Students have not been able to have their own learning initiative, so students wait for instructions or assignments from the teacher in learning.</li>
            <li>Students are not used to carrying out online learning needs at home, students learn the material according to what is given by the teacher, without the initiative to study the material independently.</li>
            <li>The goals or targets of students' online learning towards lessons are still limited to the value achieved, regardless of the process and students' ability to understand the material.</li>
            <li>Some students are still unable to monitor, manage, and control online learning at home, still seem to learn as necessary.</li>
            <li>There are still students who give up doing assignments when there are difficulties and the most mistakes made by students are students rarely evaluate the process of their learning outcomes.</li>
            <li>Some students do not have the initiative to do the assignments given by the teacher.</li>
            <li>Inadequate ICT tools.</li>
            <li>Some students cannot use ICT tools properly <i>(gagap teknologi)</i>.</li>
            <li>Some teachers have not been able to adjust to the conditions of online learning.</li>
            <li>The absence of ICT tools in some students and some areas.</li>
            <li>Inadequate learning environment (at home).</li>
            <li>Many more.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Above I wrote a problem that often occurs when school is online. My opinion on online schools is that I still have a hard time learning with this method.</p>
          <p>For me, online schooling is not too detrimental because I can explore and learn new things on the internet. For example, I can write this blog on this website because I made it because I studied Web Development and Programming from the internet.</p>
          <p>Now we are starting to turn to <i title="Pembelajaran Tatap Muka Terbatas">PTMT</i> (Limited Face-to-face Learning) that is schools with health protocols. A transition was made because the infection rate had dropped and many people had been vaccinated. For students and teachers who have been studying online for a long time, it will definitely be a little difficult to adapt.</p>
